# Noise_reduction_test
#Selection test for Develop a noise reduction engine for SCoNEs.

Implemented a basic noise reduction function in R for logRatio signal of the 2 samples contained in the test data file.

I) Available data is studied to get knowledge of the data.
  Graphical data is observed and strategy is made to detect outliers and reduce noise.
  
II)Conventional definition for outlier is not applicable here as too much data is outside the whiskers of the box
  Therefore, a factor is calculated to get appropriate range of acceptable data.
  
III)Outliers are removed and final data(noise reduced data) is again studied.
